## Self-Guided Learners

These instructions are for self-guided learners who do not have access to a pre-configured lab environment. Follow these steps to set up your environment and begin the workshop.

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to teach you about the Azure AI Agents Service and the associated SDK. It consists of multiple labs, each highlighting a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are meant to be completed in order, as each one builds on the knowledge and work from the previous lab.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/){:target="_blank"} before you begin.
1. You need a GitHub account. If you don’t have one, create it at [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}.

## Deploy the Azure Resources

This deployment creates the following resources in your Azure subscription.

- A resource group named **rg-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn**
- An **Azure AI Foundry hub** named **fdy-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn**
- An **Azure AI Foundry project** named **prj-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn**
- Two models are deployed: **gpt-4o-mini** and **text-embedding-3-small**. [See pricing.](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/){:target="\_blank"}
- Application Insights resource named **appi-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn**. [See pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=monitor){:target="\_blank"}
- To keep workshop costs low, PostgreSQL runs in a local container within your Codespace or Dev Container rather than as a cloud service. See [Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql){:target="\_blank"} to learn about options for a managed PostgreSQL service.

!!! warning "Ensure you have at least the following model quotas" - 120K TPM quota for the gpt-4o-mini Global Standard SKU, as the agent makes frequent model calls. - 50K TPM for the text-embedding-3-small model Global Standard SKU. - Check your quota in the [AI Foundry Management Center](https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/quota){:target="\_blank"}."

### Automated Deployment

Run the following bash script to automate the deployment of the resources required for the workshop. The `deploy.sh` script deploys resources to the `westus` region by default. To run the script:

```bash
cd infra && ./deploy.sh
```

### Workshop Configuration

=== "Python"

    #### Azure Resource Configuration

    The deploy script generates the **.env** file, which contains the project and model endpoints, model deployment names, and Application Insights connection string. The .env file will automatically be saved in the `src/python/workshop` folder.

    Your **.env** file will look similar to the following, updated with your values:

    ```python
    PROJECT_ENDPOINT="<your_project_endpoint>"
    GPT_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your_model_deployment_name>"
    EMBEDDING_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your_embedding_model_deployment_name>"
    APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_application_insights_connection_string>"
    AZURE_TRACING_GEN_AI_CONTENT_RECORDING_ENABLED="true"
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="<your_azure_openai_endpoint>"
    ```

    #### Azure Resource Names

    You'll also find a file named `resources.txt` in the `workshop` folder. This file contains the names of the Azure resources created during the deployment.

    I'll look similar to the following:

    ```plaintext
    Azure AI Foundry Resources:
    - Resource Group Name: rg-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn
    - AI Project Name: prj-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn
    - Foundry Resource Name: fdy-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn
    - Application Insights Name: appi-zava-agent-wks-nnnnnnnn
    ```

=== "C#"

    The script securely stores project variables using the Secret Manager for [ASP.NET Core development secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets){:target="_blank"}.

    You can view the secrets by running the following command after you have opened the C# workspace in VS Code:

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets list
    ```

## Open the VS Code Workspace

There are two VS Code workspaces in the workshop, one for Python and one for C#. The workspace contains the source code and all the files needed to complete the labs for each language. Choose the workspace that matches the language you want to work with.

=== "Python"

    1. **Copy** the following path to the clipboard:

        ```text
        /workspace/.vscode/python-workspace.code-workspace
        ```
    1. From the VS Code menu, select **File** then **Open Workspace from File**.
    3. Replace and **paste** the copied path name and select **OK**.


    ## Project Structure

    Familiarize yourself with the key **folders** and **files** in the workspace you’ll be working with throughout the workshop.

    ### The "workshop" folder

    - The **app.py** file: The entry point for the app, containing its main logic.

        Note the **INSTRUCTIONS_FILE** variable—it sets which instructions file the agent uses. You will update this variable in a later lab.

    - The **resources.txt** file: Contains the resources used by the agent app.
    - The **.env** file: Contains the environment variables used by the agent app.

    ### The "mcp_server" folder

    - The **sales_analysis.py** file: The MCP Server with tools for sales analysis.

    ### The "shared/instructions" folder

    - The **instructions** folder: Contains the instructions passed to the LLM.

    ![Lab folder structure](../../media/project-structure-self-guided-python.png)

=== "C#"

    1. In Visual Studio Code, go to **File** > **Open Workspace from File**.
    2. Replace the default path with the following:

        ```text
        /workspace/.vscode/csharp-workspace.code-workspace
        ```

    3. Select **OK** to open the workspace.

    ## Project Structure

    The project uses [Aspire](http://aka.ms/dotnet-aspire) to simplify building the agent application, managing the MCP server, and orchestrating all the external dependencies. The solution is comprised for four projects, all prefixed with `McpAgentWorkshop`:

    * `AppHost`: The Aspire orchestrator, and launch project for the workshop.
    * `McpServer`: The MCP server project.
    * `ServiceDefaults`: Default configuration for services, such as logging and telemetry.
    * `WorkshopApi`: The Agent API for the workshop. The core application logic is in the `AgentService` class.

    In addition to the .NET projects in the solution, there is a `shared` folder (visible as a Solution Folder, and via the file explorer), which contains:

    * `instructions`: The instructions passed to the LLM.
    * `scripts`: Helper shell scripts for various tasks, these will be referred to when required.
    * `webapp`: The front-end client application. Note: This is a Python application, which Aspire will manage the lifecycle of.
